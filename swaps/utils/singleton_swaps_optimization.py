__C.MATCH_FEATURES_KWARGS.align_in_log_space = True  # whether the template-matching shift search itself runs on log2(1+x)-transformed images (True) or on linear images (False). Purely an alignment/registration knob -- independent of denoise.log_transform.enabled below, which controls the separate question of whether the consensus average and per-run descriptor images end up in log space. Search always finds a shift; that shift is then applied to the linear image regardless of this flag.
__C.MATCH_FEATURES_KWARGS.use_shift_crop_pad = False  # False (default): resize every image to the reference's shape via cv2.resize before template matching. True: skip resizing -- match_template runs directly on each run's native-shaped image, and the found integer shift is applied by exact slicing (pad where the image is smaller than the reference, crop where larger) instead of interpolation.
__C.MATCH_FEATURES_KWARGS.alignment_method = "template_match"  # "template_match" (default): sliding-window match_template search of a template_frac-sized crop of the reference within each run's (possibly larger) search image, as documented above. "phase_correlation": skimage.registration.phase_cross_correlation between the FULL resized reference and each run's full resized image (FFT-based, sub-pixel accurate to 1/phase_correlation_kwargs.upsample_factor, then rounded to the nearest integer pixel) -- the global, full-image search is needed to FIND the shift (phase correlation can't crop before it knows where the signal is), but the returned registration error is then recomputed on the same template_frac-sized, anchor-centred crop template_match uses (after applying the discovered shift), not the full image -- otherwise the error's Fourier-energy terms are diluted by background pixels far from the actual peptide signal. So template_frac stays meaningful under both methods, just for different purposes: it sizes the searched crop under template_match, and the error-measurement window under phase_correlation. template_matching_score holds match_template's [0, 1] correlation score (higher = better) under template_match; under phase_correlation it holds phase_cross_correlation's (windowed) registration error instead (lower = better, unbounded) -- same column, opposite sense, so anything reading it downstream (the Mokapot feature list, delta_template_matching_score) must know which alignment_method produced a given run's rows. Requires use_shift_crop_pad=False (phase correlation needs equal-shaped image pairs) and is incompatible with broad_alignment.enabled/multi_scale_template_fracs (no windowed-search or correlation-surface concept for phase correlation) -- either combination raises a config error.

The table auto-builds (if missing) at RESULT_PATH/broad_alignment_shift_table.parquet, shared across every quantification_* config variant of the same dataset. No-ops with a warning if align_images=False. rt_shift/im_shift/template_matching_score stay real (non-NaN) values and remain in the Mokapot FDR feature list.
__C.MATCH_FEATURES_KWARGS.broad_alignment.max_deviation = 0  # radius (in RT/IM pixel units of the activation image -- one row per MS1 frame, one column per mobility bin) of the constrained search window around the calibrated shift; 0 forces the exact calibrated shift (just rescoring there), larger values allow more local refinement at some risk of drifting toward a nearby wrong peak.
__C.MATCH_FEATURES_KWARGS.broad_alignment.multi_scale_template_fracs = []  # extra template_frac values (each in (0, 0.5]) to additionally search at, alongside the main MATCH_FEATURES_KWARGS.template_frac -- adds shift_rt/shift_im/template_matching_score/delta_shift_rt/delta_shift_im/delta_template_matching_score columns suffixed "_frac_<x>" per value, for real targets AND both decoy strategies (peptide_swap decoys get a genuine re-search against each scale's own template; off_target decoys and the consensus row reuse/sentinel the same values as the main scale, mirroring how they already treat the main scale). Only takes effect when align_images=True, broad_alignment.enabled=True, and max_deviation=0 (same gating as the existing single-scale delta_* columns) -- empty list (default) = disabled, zero extra cost.

__C.MATCH_FEATURES_KWARGS.template_match_top_intensity_frac = 1.0  # restrict the template-matching correlation search to only the top n pixels by intensity in each search image/template, where n = this fraction * (reference image's pixel count) -- a fixed pixel budget derived once from the reference's own size and applied uniformly to the template and every run's search image, regardless of each image's own size. E.g. 0.05 on a 200x50-pixel reference keeps only the strongest 500 pixels per search image, zeroing the rest, to make the shift search robust to low-intensity background/noise pixels. Must be in (0, 1]; 1.0 (default) = no filtering, uses every pixel. Only affects the search space used to find rt_shift/im_shift/template_matching_score -- the returned aligned/consensus images stay unfiltered, same scope as align_in_log_space. Under alignment_method="phase_correlation" this ALSO gates the windowed registration-error crop (see alignment_method's comment): a reference_mask -- the top-n-by-intensity pixels within just that crop (n resolved from the crop's own pixel count, not the full image's) -- is derived from the reference and applied to both the reference and registered-candidate crops before recomputing the error, so background pixels inside the anchor-centred window don't count toward it either.
# denoise: smooth/clean are staged ops (smooth.at / clean.at select which pipeline
# stage each runs at); log_transform is NOT staged -- see below.
#   "raw"       → applied to each run's own image before template-matching alignment
#   "consensus" → applied to the averaged consensus image before watershed segmentation
#
# log_transform.enabled controls a single, fixed point in the pipeline that applies to
# BOTH the consensus image and every individual run's own image: log2(1+x) is applied
# exactly once, AFTER averaging (for the consensus descriptor) or AFTER alignment (for
# each run's own descriptor) -- never before, and never as part of the average itself.
# This matters because mean_i(log2(1+x_i)) != log2(1 + mean_i(x_i)): averaging
# already-logged images (a geometric-mean-like quantity, by Jensen's inequality)
# systematically under-represents the true consensus intensity/shape relative to
# log-transforming the linear-space average, and would make the consensus descriptor
# incomparable to a real run's own log2(1+x) descriptor. Keeping log_transform
# unstaged guarantees the consensus is always built by averaging in linear space first.
# Watershed segmentation (on the consensus) also has log_transform applied to it,
# after smooth/clean, consistent with the "consensus" stage order (smooth -> clean ->
# log_transform); this is separate from the alignment search space, see
# align_in_log_space above.
