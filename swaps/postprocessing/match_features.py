    `error_window_bounds` (row_start, col_start, row_end, col_end), if given,

    crop of both images at that window -- taken from `reference_image`
    directly, and from `moving_image` AFTER applying the just-discovered
    `shift` (so the two crops are in the same registered frame) -- instead of
    the full image pair. The global, full-image search above still finds
    `shift` itself (phase correlation has to search the whole image; it can't
    crop before it knows where the signal is), but the full-image error's
    src_amp/target_amp Fourier-energy terms are otherwise diluted by
    background pixels far from the actual peptide signal, so a small
    peak-centred window (typically the same template_bounds crop
    template_match uses) makes the ratio reflect how well the signal region
    itself matches rather than the whole (mostly empty) patch.

    `error_top_intensity_frac` (only consulted when `error_window_bounds` is
    also given -- MATCH_FEATURES_KWARGS.template_match_top_intensity_frac),
    if less than 1.0, further restricts the crop to a `reference_mask`: the
    top `error_top_intensity_frac` fraction of the CROPPED reference's own
    pixels by intensity (same top-n-by-intensity selection
    _keep_top_n_intensity_pixels/_resolve_top_intensity_pixel_count already
    use elsewhere, but resolved from the crop's own pixel count rather than
    the full image's, since the crop -- not the whole patch -- is the
    relevant budget here). The SAME mask (derived from the reference) then
    zeroes out non-signal pixels in both the reference and registered-moving
    crops before phase_cross_correlation runs, so background/near-zero
    pixels even inside the anchor-centred window don't count toward the
    error -- only the genuine signal region's own match quality does.
    1.0 (default) = no masking, crop-only (same as before this parameter
    existed).

    Only `error` is affected by either parameter -- the returned `shift` is
    always the unconstrained, full-image result.

    """Resize and align images to a reference template for consensus scoring.

    `alignment_method` selects the shift-finding algorithm: "template_match"
    (default, see the rest of this docstring) or "phase_correlation"
    (skimage.registration.phase_cross_correlation on the FULL resized
    reference/candidate image pair instead of a template crop within a larger
    search image -- FFT-based, sub-pixel accurate to
    `1/phase_correlation_kwargs["upsample_factor"]` then rounded to the
    nearest integer pixel). The shift itself always comes from the full,
    unconstrained image pair (phase correlation has to search the whole image
    to find the signal), but the returned `max_scores` error is then
    recomputed on the same `template_bounds` crop template_match uses
    (anchor-centred, `template_frac`-sized -- see _find_shift_via_
    phase_correlation's `error_window_bounds`), not the full image, so the
    error reflects how well the signal region itself matches rather than
    being diluted by background pixels elsewhere in the patch --
    `template_frac` therefore stays meaningful under phase_correlation too,
    just as the error-measurement window rather than the search window. Under
    "phase_correlation", `max_scores` hold this windowed registration error
    (lower is better) instead of match_template's [0, 1] correlation score
    (higher is better) -- see MATCH_FEATURES_KWARGS.alignment_method. Requires
    `use_shift_crop_pad=False` (phase correlation needs equal-shaped image
    pairs) and no `forced_shifts` (no windowed-search/correlation-surface
    concept -- MATCH_FEATURES_KWARGS.broad_alignment and
    `multi_scale_template_fracs` stay template_match-only).

    `forced_shifts`, if given, must have one entry per image (None for images
    that should still go through unconstrained template-match discovery).
    Where an entry is not None, that image still runs template-match
    discovery, but the search is restricted to a
    `(2*broad_alignment_max_deviation+1)`-wide window around the given (rt,
    im) shift instead of the whole correlation surface -- used by
    MATCH_FEATURES_KWARGS.broad_alignment to bound per-candidate discovery to
    a small neighborhood around a precalibrated, RT-binned majority-vote
    shift, for peptides too low-S/N for unconstrained template matching to
    trust on its own. `broad_alignment_max_deviation=0` collapses the window
    to the forced shift itself (rescoring there without any freedom to move).

    If `template_anchor` is not given, it defaults to the centroid of all
    anchor points -- `anchors` plus every list in `additional_anchors` (e.g.
    one per confounder-group member, scaled into the reference frame) -- so
    the template is centred on the whole group rather than pinned to a
    single candidate's own anchor; falls back to the reference image's peak
    if no anchors are provided. `template_frac` is likewise widened (never
    narrowed) to the smallest fraction that still covers every anchor point
    around the resolved template anchor, capped at 0.5.

    `align_in_log_space`, if set, runs the template-matching correlation itself on a
    log2(1+x) transform of the reference template and every candidate image, purely
    to find the shift; the discovered shift is then applied to the linear image
    either way. The returned `resized_images`/`aligned_images` (and everything built
    from them downstream: consensus averaging, descriptors) therefore always stay
    linear regardless of this flag -- see MATCH_FEATURES_KWARGS.denoise.log_transform
    for the separate, always-linear-then-log-once step applied downstream to build
    descriptor images. Only the returned `template` itself is in search space (log or
    linear, matching this flag), since its only consumer is shift-finding -- decoy
    builders that reuse it (e.g. _build_consensus_peptide_swap_decoy) read
    `align_in_log_space` back off the returned state to transform their own candidate
    image into the same space before correlating against it.

    `use_shift_crop_pad`, if set, skips cv2.resize entirely: match_template
    runs directly on each run's native-shaped image, and the found integer
    shift is applied by exact slicing (_shift_and_fit) instead of
    interpolation -- pad where a run's window is smaller than the
    reference's, crop where larger, both driven by the same shift so the two
    stay mutually registered.

    `top_intensity_frac`, if less than 1.0, restricts the correlation search
    to only the top `n = top_intensity_frac * (reference image's pixel
    count)` pixels by intensity in each search image/template (see
    _resolve_top_intensity_pixel_count / _keep_top_n_intensity_pixels),
    zeroing the rest -- `n` is fixed once from the reference's own size and
    applied uniformly to the template and every run's search image,
    regardless of each image's own size. Applied after the
    `align_in_log_space` transform, so it selects the same pixels regardless
    of that flag (rank order is preserved by the monotonic log transform).
    Same "search-space only" scope as `align_in_log_space`: the returned
    `resized_images`/`aligned_images` are unaffected, only the returned
    `template` (recorded on the returned state as `top_intensity_frac`, same
    pattern as `align_in_log_space`, for decoy builders to reuse).

    Every present member was aligned and segmented fully independently (own
    window, own anchor -- see match_features_batch's main loop), so each
    member's own mask lives in its own local coordinate frame. `member_cache
    [m]` provides that local mask plus its `placement_origin` -- where it
    lands in the group's shared, registration-only canvas
    (`group_overlap_meta[gid]["target_shape"]`, built in the group pre-pass
    purely for this placement, no watershed of its own). Masks are placed
    into that canvas via `_place_mask_in_canvas` before any comparison, so
    overlap testing is always apples-to-apples regardless of which run each
    member calls its own reference.

      - `tags`: `{mz_rank: "{group_id}_{component_index}"}` for members in a
        >=2-member overlapping connected component, where an edge between
        two members requires their PLACED masks' intersection to exceed 50%
        of EITHER member's own placed pixel count (OR direction) -- not just
        any nonzero overlap. Absent means untagged; caller defaults to -1.
      - `pixel_fraction`: `{mz_rank: float in [0, 1]}` for EVERY present
        group member (not just tagged ones) -- what fraction of this
        member's own placed pixels is also claimed by the union of every
        OTHER present member's placed mask. Never gates the tag by itself
        (only the pairwise >50% test above does); purely a continuous
        diagnostic.
      - `intensity_fraction`: same shape/semantics as `pixel_fraction`, but
        over `group_overlap_meta[gid]["intensity_image"]` (the group's own
        alignment-only consensus -- the one consistent intensity surface
        available across independently-built, independently-scaled member
        images) instead of a plain pixel count. Informational only -- never
        used for flagging, since intensity isn't reliably comparable across

    both of those branches copy an already-resolved alignment (forced or

    passed explicitly to keep this function's contract uniform).

    `additional_anchors` (e.g. every other confounder-group member's own
    per-run anchor list) only widens the template placement -- its centroid
    and required coverage radius -- and is otherwise ignored; it does not
    affect `anchors`, which remains this call's own per-run anchor points.

    call for this exact candidate -- see match_features_batch's confounder-

    Complements the other two consensus decoy strategies: peptide_swap
    substitutes the WHOLE image with a foreign one; off_target_shift keeps
    the real image but shifts the label mask; this one corrupts only an
    anchor-centred bbox (half-width `bbox_frac` * each image's own dims) the
    peak itself is expected to occupy, splicing in `source_raw_image`'s own
    geometric-center patch -- not a coordinate-matched crop, since this runs
    BEFORE alignment (no shared coordinate frame with the target yet exists,
    and using the target's own registered coordinates here would make the
    decoy's rt/im shift and template_matching_score collapse onto the
    target's own already-resolved values instead of being independently
    discovered). `target_anchor`, if given (Reference/Quant_Only runs, whose
    real predicted apex is already known), centers the target-side bbox
    there; otherwise (Match runs, whose true peak position isn't known until
    alignment discovers it) it falls back to `target_raw_image`'s own
    geometric center -- windows are already built centred on the predicted
    RT/IM, so this sits close to where the real peak is expected. The source
    patch is resized only if it doesn't already match the target bbox's own
    pixel shape (native per-peptide window sizes can differ) -- no whole-
    image resize of either side.

    Everything outside the bbox is genuine target content, so the returned
    image is a partial, not full, corruption -- probing whether scoring
    stays sensitive to the peak's own local image content even after a
    plausible-looking realignment, not just whether a wrong image or a
    mis-positioned mask can be told apart from a right one.

    Returns None if either image's own bbox is degenerate (frac too large

    same "must earn its own shift/score, not borrow the target's" reasoning
    as bbox_swap.

    Unlike bbox_swap (which swaps in a real foreign peptide's own signal --
    genuine peak shape, just the wrong identity), this destroys spatial
    coherence outright: sampling per-pixel (independently, with replacement
    if the background pool is smaller than the bbox) scrambles whatever
    texture ends up in the bbox into incoherent noise, regardless of where
    the source pixels came from. That's also why no foreign peptide needs to
    be fetched, and no peak-free verification of the source region is
    needed, unlike bbox_swap's own non-empty retry loop -- the per-pixel
    resampling destroys any coherent shape a real peak in the source might
    have had anyway. Sampling from the rest of THIS image (rather than
    elsewhere) is simultaneously the cheapest construction (zero extra I/O,
    no candidate-pool selection) and a realistic noise source (this run's
    own actual background/chemical-baseline intensity distribution, not a
    synthesized one).

    `target_anchor`/`bbox_frac` behave exactly as in
    _build_bbox_swap_decoy_raw_image (own known anchor when available, else

        Fraction of each image dimension used as the half-extent of the
        template patch (``±template_frac * dim``).  Must be in ``(0, 0.5)``.
        Default is ``0.3``.
    visualize : bool, optional

        Panel titles for the visualisation.  Must have the same length as
        *images* when provided.
    fig_dir : str or None, optional
        Directory in which the figure is saved.  When *None* the figure is
        only shown interactively.
    filename : str, optional
        File-name used when saving the figure.  Default is
        ``"consensus_image.png"``.

    Returns
    -------
    consensus : 2-D ndarray
        Mean image computed over all aligned images.
    aligned_images : list of 2-D ndarray
        The n resized and aligned images (same order as *images*).
